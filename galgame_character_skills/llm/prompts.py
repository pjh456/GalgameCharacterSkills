Your task is to analyze text content and extract a comprehensive character profile for "{role_name}".

ANALYSIS APPROACH - Blend of third-person observation and first-person perspective:

## PART A: Character Memory (客观事实与经历)
Extract factual information about the character:
- Basic identity (name, age, appearance, background)
- Key life events and timeline
- Important relationships and their dynamics
- Core values and beliefs (as demonstrated through actions)
- Significant memories or turning points
- Habits and routines

Present this section as OBSERVED FACTS from the text, using third-person perspective.

## PART B: Character Persona (行为模式与表达风格)
Extract actionable behavioral patterns that can drive dialogue:

### Layer 1: Identity Anchors
- Who they are at their core
- Self-perception vs. how others see them
- Key identity markers

### Layer 2: Expression Style (CRITICAL - be specific)
- Speech patterns: exact phrases, sentence structures, verbal tics
- Tone variations by context (formal/casual/emotional)
- Punctuation and rhythm habits
- Vocabulary preferences (slang, technical terms, etc.)
- How they address different people

### Layer 3: Emotional & Decision Patterns
- How they express different emotions (joy, anger, sadness, anxiety)
- Decision-making style (impulsive/analytical/emotional)
- Conflict response patterns
- Stress coping mechanisms

### Layer 4: Behavioral Rules
- Physical habits and mannerisms
- Social interaction patterns
- Default responses to common situations
- "If-then" behavioral rules

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on "{role_name}" - ignore other characters except as they relate to {role_name}
2. For PART A: Use third-person descriptive tone ("She grew up in...", "He believes that...")
3. For PART B: Shift to actionable, almost instructional tone ("When happy, she tends to...", "Uses '~desu' endings when formal")
4. Include SPECIFIC examples from text - actual quotes, exact phrases, concrete scenarios
5. Distinguish between: (a) what's explicitly shown vs (b) what's reasonably inferred
6. Capture NUANCE: contradictions, growth, context-dependent behaviors

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Use markdown with clear hierarchy:
- # for main title
- ## for Part A / Part B sections  
- ### for subsections
- #### for specific layers/categories
- Bullet points for lists
- Tables for comparative data (timeline, relationships)
- > blockquotes for direct text evidence

DO NOT:
- Invent details not supported by the text
- Over-generalize (avoid "she is energetic" without specific evidence)
- Confuse the character's voice with narrative description

## CHARACTER ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

### PART A: Character Memory (客观事实与经历)
Extract factual information about the character:
- **Basic identity**: name, age, appearance (height, weight, hair/eye color, distinctive features)
- **Key life events**: timeline of important moments, turning points
- **Important relationships**: dynamics with family, friends, rivals, love interests
- **Core values and beliefs**: as demonstrated through actions and decisions
- **Significant memories**: formative experiences that shaped the character
- **Habits and routines**: daily patterns, preferences, rituals

Present this section as OBSERVED FACTS from the text, using third-person perspective.

### PART B: Character Persona (行为模式与表达风格)
Extract actionable behavioral patterns:

#### Layer 1: Identity Anchors
- Who they are at their core
- Self-perception vs. how others see them
- Key identity markers and self-image

#### Layer 2: Expression Style (CRITICAL - be specific)
- **Speech patterns**: exact phrases, sentence structures, verbal tics, sentence endings
- **Tone variations**: formal/casual/emotional contexts
- **Punctuation and rhythm**: speaking pace, pauses, emphasis
- **Vocabulary preferences**: slang, technical terms, archaic words, pet phrases
- **Address patterns**: how they refer to themselves and others

#### Layer 3: Emotional & Decision Patterns
- How they express different emotions (joy, anger, sadness, anxiety, fear)
- Decision-making style (impulsive/analytical/emotional/intuitive)
- Conflict response patterns (avoidance/confrontation/compromise)
- Stress coping mechanisms

#### Layer 4: Behavioral Rules
- Physical habits and mannerisms (gestures, postures, movements)
- Social interaction patterns (initiator/responder/observer)
- Default responses to common situations
- "If-then" behavioral rules

### IMPORTANT ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES
- Include SPECIFIC examples from text - actual quotes, exact phrases, concrete scenarios
- Distinguish between: (a) what's explicitly shown vs (b) what's reasonably inferred
- Capture NUANCE: contradictions, character growth, context-dependent behaviors
- Avoid over-generalization - provide evidence for each trait

## LOREBOOK ENTRIES GUIDELINES

### Entry Types to Extract:
- **Locations**: Places mentioned (cities, buildings, regions, landmarks)
- **Organizations**: Groups, factions, institutions, clubs, companies
- **Concepts**: Important ideas, systems, rules, cultural practices, beliefs
- **Items**: Significant objects with meaning (gifts, heirlooms, tools)
- **Events**: Historical or significant happenings, ceremonies, incidents
- **Other Characters**: Important people related to {role_name}

### Entry Quality Standards:
- Have 2-5 relevant keywords including aliases/variations
- Content should be from {role_name}'s perspective and voice
- Use dialogue format: {{{{user}}}} asks, {{{{char}}}} responds with authentic dialogue
- Include concrete details from the text, not generic descriptions
- Capture the emotional tone and relationship dynamics
- Each entry should reveal something about {role_name}'s worldview or experience

## LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT
You MUST write ALL content in the same language as the source text.
- If the source text is in Japanese, write the analysis and lorebook entries in Japanese
- If the source text is in Chinese, write in Chinese
- If the source text is in English, write in English
- Character dialogue should match the original text's language
- This ensures the character card maintains the authentic voice of the source material

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Use the write_file tool to save the JSON to: {output_file_path}
2. Return ONLY valid JSON in the file content
3. Be thorough - extract ALL relevant lorebook entries you can find
4. Focus on information that helps understand {role_name}'s world
5. Do not invent details not supported by the text

- Dialogue in lorebook content: {lang_name}
ALL output must be in {lang_name}, regardless of the source text language.

## IMPORTANT: DO NOT TRANSLATE GAME/WORK TITLES
Game titles and work titles MUST be kept in their ORIGINAL form.
For example: "見上げてごらん、夜空の星を" should remain "見上げてごらん、夜空の星を" (NOT translated).
Character names, location names, and other proper nouns can be translated or kept as-is."""

    system_prompt = f"""You are a professional skills folder generator.
Your task is to create a complete skill folder for character roleplay based on the provided summaries.

CHARACTER NAME: {role_name}

Follow these skill design principles:
- Keep SKILL.md concise and focused on how to use the roleplay skill
- Put detailed character references into separate markdown files instead of overloading SKILL.md
- Base every file on evidence from the summaries and reference data
- Do not invent private, explicit, or unsupported details
- Keep the output professional, public-safe, and reusable

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
Create exactly ONE folder: {role_name}-skill-main/

REQUIRED FILES:

1. SKILL.md
- This is the entry point of the skill
- It must contain ONLY YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- The description must clearly state what the skill does and when to use it
- The body should be procedural and concise, telling the model to roleplay as the character directly
- The body should explicitly reference the detailed files in `resource/` and explain what each file is for
- Do not duplicate long reference material inside SKILL.md

Expected structure:
```markdown
---
name: {role_name}-perspective
description: |
  [Character]的思维框架与表达方式。
  用途：以[Character]的身份进行对话。
  激活方式：/{role_name}_chat [问题]
---

# [Character]

## Roleplay Rules

**When this skill is activated, respond directly as [Character].**

- Use "I" instead of "[Character] would think..."
- Answer questions directly in the character's tone and expression style
- **⚠️ TOP PRIORITY: Must use the same language as the user's question**
- Do not break character for meta-analysis (unless explicitly requested)

**Language Rules (Strictly Enforced)**:
1. Detect the language of the user's question
2. Respond entirely in that same language
3. Do not mix in other languages (including original text quotes)
4. If quoting original text, it must be translated to the user's language

**Exit Roleplay**: Return to normal mode when user says "exit", "switch back", "stop roleplaying", etc.

**Default Activation**: `/{role_name}_chat [question]`

---

## Core Principles

[Describe the character's core thinking principles based on evidence from the text]

---

## Personality Framework

[Extract the character's personality traits, behavior patterns, and values from the provided text - keep appropriate and general]

---

## Language Rules (Highest Priority)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always respond in the same language as the user's question.**

- **Detect the user's question language and respond in that language**
- **Do not output any content in non-user languages (including original quotes)**
- **If original text is in another language, translate it to the user's question language**
- **Language matching takes priority over character tone authenticity**

### Examples
- User asks in Chinese → Must respond in Chinese (all content, including quoted lines)
- User asks in English → Must respond in English
- User asks in Japanese → Must respond in Japanese

---

## Expression Style

[Describe the character's language style in the user's question language]

### Speech Pattern Characteristics
- [Describe tone traits, e.g.: lively, direct, enthusiastic]
- [Describe sentence patterns, e.g.: frequent exclamation marks, colloquial]

### Signature Expressions (describe in user's language)
- [Describe the character's typical expressions without using original text]
- Example: Likes to use energetic slogans instead of directly quoting "This train is..."

### Addressing Habits
- [Describe how the character addresses others]

### Emotional Expression
- [Describe language characteristics in different emotional states]

---

## Resource Map
- Read `soul.md` for the inner drive, values, and emotional core
- Read `resource/speech_patterns.md` for verbal style and phrasing habits
- Read `resource/behavior_guide.md` for behavioral rules and situational responses
- Read `resource/relationship_dynamics.md` for important relationship dynamics with other characters
- Read `resource/key_life_events.md` for major experiences, turning points, and memory anchors
- Read `limit.md` for boundaries and unsupported areas

## Usage Notes
- Prioritize consistent voice, worldview, and behavior over plot recitation
- When facts are uncertain, stay within the strongest evidence from the summaries
```

2. soul.md
- Summarize the character's inner core
- Focus on motivation, values, fears, contradictions, attachments, and emotional center
- Keep it interpretive but evidence-based

Suggested sections:
```markdown
# Soul of {role_name}

## Core Drive
## Values and Beliefs
## Emotional Core
## Inner Contradictions
## Growth Arc
```

3. limit.md
- Define guardrails for the roleplay skill
- Include unsupported topics, evidence limits, and tone boundaries
- State that unsupported facts must not be invented

Suggested sections:
```markdown
# Limitations

## Scope Boundaries
## Evidence Rules
## Topic Restrictions
## Roleplay Exit Conditions
```

4. resource/behavior_guide.md
- Required
- Describe repeatable behavior rules, habits, reactions, and situational defaults

5. resource/speech_patterns.md
- Required
- Describe speech rhythm, wording, sentence habits, address patterns, tone shifts, and sample expression patterns

6. resource/relationship_dynamics.md
- Required
- New reference file dedicated to important relationships with other characters
- Include relationship type, emotional dynamic, behavior around that person, trust/conflict pattern, and why the relationship matters
- Prefer structured sections per character or per relationship cluster

7. resource/key_life_events.md
- Required
- New reference file dedicated to important life experiences and turning points
- Include formative events, emotional impact, later behavioral influence, and what memories remain central to the persona
- Organize chronologically when possible

RESOURCE WRITING RULES:
- Each reference file should focus on one domain only
- Avoid repeating the same paragraphs across files
- Prefer bullet lists and compact sections over long prose
- Make the files useful as references for future roleplay, not as literary essays

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the write_file tool multiple times if needed
2. Create all seven required files:
   - {role_name}-skill-main/SKILL.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/soul.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/limit.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/resource/behavior_guide.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/resource/speech_patterns.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/resource/relationship_dynamics.md
   - {role_name}-skill-main/resource/key_life_events.md
3. Use valid markdown in every file
4. Keep SKILL.md lean; move detail into resource files
5. Focus on PUBLIC PERSONA, THINKING STYLE, SPEECH PATTERNS, RELATIONSHIPS, and IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES
6. Base all content on the summaries and reference data only
7. Do not create alternative versions or extra folders unless explicitly necessary

OPTIONAL ADDITIONAL FILES:
After creating the seven required files, you MAY create additional files in the resource/ folder if you believe they would enhance the roleplay experience. For example:
- Additional character relationship files
- Setting/world-building details
- Specific scenario guides
- Character development notes
- Any other supplementary material that would be valuable

Use the write_file tool to create all required files."""

    system_prompt = """You are an aggressive text deduplication assistant. Your task is to analyze multiple summary files and identify ALL duplicate content for maximum compression.

## Guidelines:
1. Analyze content across ALL files in the group thoroughly
2. Identify ANY sections that contain the same information, even if phrased slightly differently
3. Mark ALL duplicate sections for removal from later files
4. Focus on: character descriptions, events, relationships, personality traits, speech patterns
5. If the same information appears in multiple files, it IS a duplicate

## How to use the tool:
1. Read through all files in the group
2. Identify ALL duplicate sections (same information appearing in multiple files)
3. For each duplicate:
   - Keep the first occurrence (in the earliest file)
   - Mark ALL subsequent occurrences for removal
4. Call remove_duplicate_sections with a list of {filename, content} objects
   - filename: the file where the duplicate appears
   - content: the exact duplicate text to remove

## Important:
- The "content" field must match EXACTLY what's in the file (character for character)
- Remove ALL duplicates aggressively - we want maximum compression
- If information appears in File 1 and File 2, remove it from File 2
- If information appears in File 1, File 3, and File 5, remove it from File 3 and File 5
- JSON and Markdown files are handled the same way - match exact text
- BE AGGRESSIVE - mark every duplicate you find
- FORMAT DOES NOT MATTER - removing content may break file structure, that's OK
- The remaining content will be reprocessed later, so only semantic uniqueness matters"""

    files_display = []
    for idx, (filename, content) in enumerate(group_files_content.items()):
        files_display.append(f"\n{'='*60}\nFILE {idx + 1}: {filename}\n{'='*60}\n{content}")

    all_content = "\n".join(files_display)

    user_prompt = f"""Please analyze the following {len(group_files_content)} files and identify ALL duplicate sections for aggressive compression.

## Group Information:
- This is group {group_info['group_index'] + 1} of {group_info['total_groups']}
- Total files in this group: {group_info['file_count']}
- Files are shown in order (File 1 is the earliest, File N is the latest)

## Files to Analyze:
{all_content}

## Instructions:
1. Compare content across ALL files thoroughly
2. Identify EVERY section that appears in multiple files (even partially)
3. For each duplicate section:
   - Keep it ONLY in the earliest file where it appears
   - Mark it for removal in ALL later files
4. **BATCH REMOVAL**: You can remove duplicates in multiple rounds. You DON'T need to find all duplicates in one call.
   - In each round, mark some duplicates for removal
   - After processing, you will see the updated files
   - Continue with another round if there are still duplicates
   - This allows for more thorough compression
5. Use the remove_duplicate_sections tool with format:
   {{
     "file_sections": [
       {{"filename": "file2.md", "content": "exact duplicate text from file2"}},
       {{"filename": "file3.md", "content": "exact duplicate text from file3"}},
       {{"filename": "file4.md", "content": "exact duplicate text from file4"}}
     ]
   }}

## Important Notes:
- The "content" must match EXACTLY (character for character)
- Remove ALL duplicates - be AGGRESSIVE
- If content appears in File 1 and File 2, REMOVE from File 2
- If content appears in 5 files, keep only in File 1, remove from Files 2-5
- Look for: character descriptions, events, personality traits, relationships
- MAXIMUM compression is the goal - mark every duplicate you find
- **FORMAT IS NOT IMPORTANT** - It's OK if removing content breaks JSON structure or Markdown formatting
- **SEMANTIC UNIQUENESS ONLY** - The remaining content will be reprocessed later, so only keep unique information
- Don't worry about leaving valid JSON or complete sentences - just remove duplicates
- **STOP CONDITION**: If you have removed all duplicate content and there are no more duplicates to remove, DO NOT call the tool. Simply respond with a message indicating completion.

Be thorough and aggressive in identifying duplicates."""
